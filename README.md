# Lesson Creation Workflow

A Claude-powered workflow for creating structured, educationally grounded lesson materials — including a lesson plan, exercises, an answer key, and MARP slides — from a single conversation.

## What This Repo Is

This repository contains the configuration and context files that instruct Claude on how to generate complete lesson packages. It is built around two principles:

- **Educational quality**: All lessons are grounded in Ken Bain's research-backed teaching principles (from *What the Best College Teachers Do*), as described in `educational_context.MD`.
- **Structured output**: Each lesson produces a consistent set of files organized in its own folder.

## Output per Lesson

For every lesson, Claude creates a folder `lessons/<topic-slug>/` containing:

| File | Description |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `lesson.md` | Full lesson plan with learning objectives |
| `exercises.md` | In-class and follow-up exercises |
| `answers.md` | Model answers and grading notes (teacher-facing) |
| `slides.md` | MARP slide deck source |
| `slides.pdf` | Rendered PDF slide deck |

## How to Use

Open this repository in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and start a new conversation. Claude will automatically load the workflow from `claude.md` and guide you through the following steps:

1. **Topic** — Describe the lesson topic, target audience, and duration
2. **Sources** — Provide URLs, local files, or references to use as input
3. **Lesson plan** — Claude creates `lesson.md` and asks for your approval
4. **Exercise context** — Specify format, collaboration style, and constraints
5. **Exercises** — Claude creates `exercises.md` with in-class and follow-up exercises, plus `answers.md` with model answers and grading notes
6. **Slides** — Claude creates `slides.md` and renders it to `slides.pdf` via MARP CLI

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI
- [MARP CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) installed (`marp` available on PATH)

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
